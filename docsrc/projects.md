# Projects 

## Overview
The course project provides the opportunity to blend your newly acquired
computational skills with the theories, methods, and models of regional and
spatial analysis. The initial weeks of the quarter will provide a primer in
open source tools. After that, the focus of the course switches to project
work. Course meetings will then be dedicated to concentrated collaboration on
the group project, which should supplement work being done outside the class
meetings.

## Project Grading

Each student's project grade constitutes 50 percent of their overall grade for the course. The project grade for a student will be determined using the following weighting:

| Component              | Weight | Notes      |
|------------------------|--------|------------|
| Documentation          |     35 | Group      |
| Presentation           |     15 | Group      |
| Individual commits/PRs |     30 | Individual |
| Peer evaluation        |     15 | Individual |
| Self evaluation        |      5 | Individual |


### Documentation

For each group, final documentation for the course project will be required. This documentation will consist of the following components
1. Project proposal (5 points,  *Due May 5 5pm*)

   1. identification of the team
   1. identification of data sets that will be used
   1. at least 5 references from academic literature related to the topic
   1. draft list of tasks and two milestones on GitHub Project Repository

4. Final paper that reports on the research findings (20 points *Due June 4 5pm*)
5. Project reproducibility documentation (10 points *Due June 4 5pm*)

The final paper should take the form of a manuscript that could be submitted
for publication. The project reproducibility documentation will is to be contained
on the project repository and allow an interested user (like the instructor) to
reproduce the analysis presented in final paper.


### Presentation

Each group will be required to present their findings on the date of the final examination.

   ### Individual commits/PRs

Based on analysis of the git logs for the project, the instructor will evaluate the contributions of each individual to the project. Contributions can be of the following forms:

- accepted commits
- pull requests 
- issues reported
- issues closed
- commenting on issues/pull requests


### Peer evaluation
Each student will be required to complete a confidential evaluation of their team members.

### Self evaluation
Each student will be required to complete a self evaluation.
## Project Portfolio ##

The list of potential projects follows. Students will submit a ranked
preference for working on these, and project assignments will be made to
optimize matching.

### Neighborhood Change and Schools ###

#### Components (Initial Ideas)

- Enhance [GeoSNAP](https://github.com/spatialucr/geosnap) to integrate schools into neighborhood clustering algorithms
- Develop analytics to measure neighborhood change
- Develop analytics to measure school change
- Integrative analysis of neighborhood and school change

### Spatial Inequality Dynamics
#### Components (Initial Ideas)
- Implement a web-based version of [STARS: Space-Time Analysis of Regional
  Systems](https://github.com/sjsrey/stars)
- Rely on [PySAL](http://pysal.org/) for existing analytics
- Use [CGS Quilt](https://open.quiltdata.com/b/spatial-ucr) as data infrastructure
- Evaluate alternative web-based visualization tool kits
- Deliver a prototype
- Test on a new spatial inequality data set

### Environmental Justice & Primary Education ###
#### Components (Initial Ideas)
- Analyze the spatial relationship between school demography, 
- Combine data from the [EPA](https://open.quiltdata.com/b/spatial-ucr/tree/epa/ejscreen/) and the [NCES](https://open.quiltdata.com/b/spatial-ucr/tree/nces/schools/) from CGS's quilt bucket, along with [SEDA](https://edopportunity.org/) to create a school-level analysis
- Examine whether schools with different demographic characteristics are exposed to different levels of environmental quality, and whether a relationship exists between educational opportunity and healthy environments
- Develop an interactive notebook structured as a article/narrative that describes your findings to a general audience
